# Predicting Bike Rentals

Bike sharing systems continue to pop up in a number of cities across the world as an alternative form of transportation. The popularity of these systems can be attributed to their ease of use and the important role they play in combating various issues, including climate change. It's estimated that over 500 bike sharing programs composed of over 5000 bikes are operating around the world today.

One of the appeals of these systems from a data science perspective is the way they explicitly record the duration of travel, departure and arrival position of each bike. By analysing this data we can get an idea of the level of mobility in a city at a given time.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto realised the value of this data for machine learning and compiled bike sharing data for Washington, D.C., along with corresponding weather and seasonal information, into a CSV file. The data is publicly available on theÂ [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

The aim of this project is to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour under different environmental and seasonal conditions. To do this I'll create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance. Once a good model is identified, it can be used to forecast periods of increased mobility in the city.

This project was completed as part of the [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/decision-trees/) course on Decision Trees. This course forms part of the Data Scientist in Python pathway.
